This is a self-made case study using dataset from MEHMET TAHIR ASLAN (Customer Shopping Dataset - Retail Sales Data) on Kaggle.
I'm splitting 2 tables from the dataset table to work on JOIN function in SQL.

-- Data formatting
alter table cust_sales
add id int auto_increment primary key;
alter table cust_sales modify id int after invoice_no;
alter table cust_sales modify invoice_no text after id;

alter table cust
add id int auto_increment primary key;
alter table cust modify id int after invoice_no;
alter table cust modify invoice_no text after id;

update cust_sales set invoice_date = str_to_date(invoice_date,"%d/%m/%Y");
alter table cust_sales modify invoice_date date;

-- Total Shopping Mall
select count(distinct shopping_mall) TotalMall
from cust_sales
;

-- 1.	What is the total customer has been shopping for each shopping mall in Istanbul?
select shopping_mall 'Shopping Mall', count(customer_id) 'Total Customer'

order by 'total customer' desc;

-- 2.	What are the average sales of fashion and beauty products in each month for each shopping mall in each year?
